##AngularJS Advanced
### how to structure and fine-tune HTML5 in the Real World applications

* After the initial _Wow_ phase, developers adopting Angular face many challenging choices about how to architect, design, decompose and implement production-ready applications.

* The workshop shares the experience gained in the development of several mobile and enterprise HTML5 applications. It gives participants a solid understanding of what is needed to best take advantage of the "Angular Way" in structuring your application:

  * Angular internals
  * composability, directives, promises
  * trade-offs and best practices



##TRAINING OBJECTIVES
With an hands-on approach, we will discuss what's needed beyond the
_Hello World_, in order to face the many challenges of developing a demanding application:

* designing module structure
* implementing robust apps with BDD tests
* maximizing productivity and maintainability by adopting the _Angular
Way_ (the architectural style of Angular itself) in your application
code
* managing navigation
* achieving complex interaction between the various UI and logic
elements without coupling them
* integrating non-angular code
* maximizing reuse and creating custom views by creating modular directives



##WHO THE WORKSHOP IS DEDICATED TO?
* The advanced AngularJS workshop is aimed at web developers with a
basic understanding of HTML5 and Javascript, who, after discovering
the power of Angular JS want to adopt it in real-world projects and feel the need for learning a structured and productive approach to developing awesome HTML5 sites and apps.
